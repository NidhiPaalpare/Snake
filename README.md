# Snake

Snake is one of the most timeless games to exist, it truly throws us back to the times of motorolla and nokia flip phones.
I salute this wholesome game by implementing a simplified version in Assembly.
Why Assembly? ...you may ask 
and to that I answer...
1. Why not?
2. My uni made me :) 

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repo into your local machine.
2. If you do not already have it install *QtSpim* [here](https://qtspim.software.informer.com/9.1/)- QtSpim is a software which assists you in simulating the execution of a MIPS assembly programs.

## Usage
1. Click *File* and load in *snake.s*
2. Click *Simulator* > *Run/Continue*

## How to play!
This game works like common pc games. Controls are:
* *w* - up
* *a* - left
* *d* - right
* *s* - down 

Try your best to maximise your score by eating as many apples as possible, don't run into an edge, don't run into yourself and make sure to... HAVE FUN!
